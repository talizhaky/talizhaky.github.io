<p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. I started playing piano at the age of 5 and then added on a few more instruments. I've played in many pit orchestras over the last 7 years including <i> Mary Poppins </i>, <i>Shrek the Musical</i>, and <i> The Wizard of Oz</i>. Towards the end of high school I was introduced to the business side of the music industry and fell in love with it. I made the decision to move from Seattle to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music and study Music Business with a concentration in management.</p>

<p>I'm about to graduate this May with a B.A. in Music Business, Management. Throughout Berklee I've had the opportunity to be a part of the Berklee Music Business Club, Berklee Artist Development (A&R) Club, as well as study at Berklee's Valencia, Spain campus! I've also been able to gain valuable music business experience through internships over the last 3 years. My most recent internship being with <a href="http://braincandymgmt.com" target="_blank"> Brain Candy Management </a> as a publishing intern. I have worked my way up and am now the head of music publishing and sync!</p>

<p>My passion in the music industry has always been to help artists spread their voice. Recently, that passion has morphed into “stop artists from getting screwed over by major labels”. I'm super excited to see how I can further help artist’s as Brain Candy’s Head of Publishing/Sync. </p>
